## FAQ Section
### Section Title
**Frequently Asked Questions**

### FAQs
#### How does HeyZack differ from other smart home systems?
Unlike traditional smart home systems that require explicit commands and app-based control, HeyZack creates truly intelligent environments that learn and adapt to your preferences. Our technology understands context and anticipates needs rather than simply responding to direct commands.

#### Is my data secure with HeyZack?
Absolutely. We've built our system with privacy at its core. Most processing happens locally on your devices rather than in the cloud, and you always maintain control over what information is collected and how it's used.

#### Can HeyZack integrate with my existing smart devices?
Yes. Our platform is designed to work with major smart home standards including Matter, Thread, Zigbee, and Wi-Fi, allowing integration with most popular smart home devices and systems.

#### How long does installation typically take?
For residential installations, most systems can be fully operational within 1-3 days depending on the size and complexity of your home. Commercial installations typically require 3-10 days depending on the scope of the project.

#### Is ongoing maintenance required?
HeyZack systems are designed to be largely self-maintaining with automatic updates and optimizations. We provide regular system health checks and updates as part of our service plans to ensure optimal performance.

*Design Note: Display FAQs in a clean, expandable accordion format with question text in Brinnan Bold and answers in Space Grotesk Regular. Use subtle blue accents for interactive elements, with proper spacing between items for optimal readability.*
